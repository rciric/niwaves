Translating complexity

## What is niwaves?

Many tools used to interrogate complex systems in neuroimaging are written in Matlab. niwaves aims to translate these tools in order to open them to the Python ecosystem. The scope of this project is rather limited, so we hope that our efforts are cannibalised into a more mature toolbox at some point in the future.

On our to-do list:

1. Lag and lag threads

2. [Network community toolbox](http://commdetect.weebly.com)

3. [Network control](https://www.danisbassett.com/research-projects.html)

4. [Algebraic topology](https://www.aesizemore.com/network-toolboxes.html)

Central to implementing many of these tools will be operationalising a substitute for the excellent [`genlouvain`](http://netwiki.amath.unc.edu/GenLouvain/GenLouvain).
